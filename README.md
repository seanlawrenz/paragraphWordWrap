# Paragraph Word Wrap

## Requirements

Format the text below to wrap the lines to a width of 80 characters without breaking words. You must maintain the empty line between paragraphs.

## How to run

This was run on node 11.10.0.

If you are not currently on node 10 or above nvm is a great way to manage node versions.

After node is installed navigate to this folder on the terminal, command line, or powershell and run:

```
node index.js
```

It will then console log the newly formatted text to the requirements above.
